    <h1> The Scream </h1>
    <p> The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893.<br>
        The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title<br>
        under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature).<br>
        The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images<br>
        in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work,<br>
        including The Scream, had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.
        Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting<br>
        sun's light turned the clouds "a blood red". He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature".<br>
        Scholars have located the spot along a fjord path overlooking Oslo and have suggested various<br>
        explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption<br>
        to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.<br>
        Munch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from<br>
        which several prints survive. Both painted versions have been stolen from public museums,<br>
        but since recovered. In 2012, one of the pastel versions commanded the highest nominal price<br>
        paid for an artwork at a public auction at that time. </p>
